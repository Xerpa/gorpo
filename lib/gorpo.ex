defmodule Gorpo do
  @moduledoc """
  An OTP application that announce services on consul. After a
  successful start `Gorpo.Announce` process will be
  running. Unconfigured, it assumes consul is running on localhost:8500
  requiring no ACL and no services are announced.

  Optionally you may provide services that gets announce when this
  application starts. For instance:

      iex> # you may need to restart the application after this
      iex> Application.put_env(:gorpo, :announce, [services: [[id: "foo", name: "bar", check: [ttl: "1s"]]]])
      :ok

  This will announce a service `"bar"` with a health check with a
  `TTL` of `1s`. You may pass additional information [like `tags`] as
  long as they exist in the `Gorpo.Service` [or `Gorpo.Check`]
  struct. Refer to those modules for more information.

  You continue being able to register/unregister a service
  dynamically. Notice that services configured in the application are
  nothing special: you may unregister them like other services you may
  have registered afterwords.

  Starts the `Gorpo` application. `Application.put_env(:gorpo, ...)`
